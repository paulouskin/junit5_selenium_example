Feature: Search for items (table mode)
  As a user
  I want to search for different items
  So that I will be able to buy necessary items fast

  Scenario Outline: Search for items
    Given I am on the main page
    And I accept terms and conditions
    When I search for "<query>" items
    Then I see search results
    And I get search results for "<result>" items

    Examples:
    |query|result|
    |leather bag    |leather bag      |
    |paper toy     |paper toy      |
